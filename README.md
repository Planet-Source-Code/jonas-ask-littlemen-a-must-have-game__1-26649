### Description

Tired of all these BORING "data from txt", "hide the minimize button" projects ;) ? Well then this is just the thing for you! And all you others too! A REALLY FUN GAME!! This is a BIG game, with full graphics, AI and hilarious sound! A MUST SEE! This is guaranteed something you do NOT see every day here on PLSC. I'm not kiddin' you must see this, I spend weeks on it (and I think I'll develop it even further) and truly is a lot of fun! Truly a one of a kind VB project, and I spend lots of hours on it so, I beg you, GIVE ME FEEDBACK!!! PLEASE! =) ANY kind will do! And if you like it, please give it a vote :) I'm not pushing you, hehe.
